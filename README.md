# 🧠 Feature Mart for Data Science Models

Welcome to the **Feature Mart** repository — a centralized, scalable, and reusable store of engineered features designed to accelerate and standardize machine learning workflows across projects.

## 📌 Overview

This repository serves as a **feature store** that enables consistent feature engineering, versioning, and sharing across data science teams. It is built to support both batch and real-time use cases, ensuring that models are trained and served with reliable, reproducible features.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

- **Reusable Feature Pipelines**: Modular and well-documented feature definitions for easy reuse across models.
- **Version Control**: Track changes to feature logic and datasets over time.
- **Metadata Management**: Includes feature descriptions, owners, data sources, and lineage.
- **Integration Ready**: Designed to plug into model training pipelines and production scoring systems.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports large-scale data processing using Spark, Pandas, or SQL-based workflows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, PySpark)
- SQL (for feature extraction from relational databases)
- Airflow (optional: for orchestration)
- Parquet/Delta Lake (for storage)
- Git (for version control)
