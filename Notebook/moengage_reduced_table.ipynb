    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "This query creates a new table `dap_ds_poweruser_playground.temp_reduced_moeng_event_hourly` (or replaces it if it exists) by filtering specific events from the source table `moengage_raw.events_hourly`. The filtered events include critical user actions like app launches, loan calculator interactions, and device uninstall/reinstall events.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Query Structure\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `dap_ds_poweruser_playground.temp_reduced_moeng_event_hourly` AS  -- Step 3\n",
    "WITH b AS (  -- Step 1: CTE to filter source data\n",
    "  SELECT \n",

    "    event_name LIKE ANY ('Loans_%_Calculator')  -- Condition A2\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logic Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: Filter Source Data (CTE `b`)\n",
    "The CTE `b` extracts records from `moengage_raw.events_hourly` using a `WHERE` clause with **three distinct conditions** (combined with `OR`):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Condition A1: Explicit `event_name` Match**  \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   event_name IN ('App_Launch')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Includes records where `event_name` is exactly `App_Launch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Condition A2: Pattern-Based `event_name` Match**  \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   event_name LIKE ANY ('Loans_%_Calculator')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Uses wildcard `%` to match `event_name` values starting with `Loans_` and ending with `_Calculator`.  \n",
    "   - Examples: `Loans_Mortgage_Calculator`, `Loans_Auto_Calculator`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Condition B: `event_code` Whitelist**  \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   event_code IN ('App_Launch', 'Device Uninstall', 'REINSTALL')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Includes records where `event_code` is one of:  \n",
    "     - `App_Launch` (distinct from the `event_name` filter)  \n",
    "     - `Device Uninstall`  \n",
    "     - `REINSTALL`  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Notes on Conditions:\n",
    "- **`OR` Logic**: A record is included if it satisfies **any** of the three conditions (A1, A2, or B).  \n",
    "- **Overlap Handling**:  \n",
    "  - A record with `event_name = 'App_Launch'` (A1) will be included even if `event_code` is not in the whitelist (B).  \n",
    "  - A record with `event_code = 'App_Launch'` (B) will be included even if `event_name` is not `App_Launch` or a loan calculator event.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2: Materialize Results\n",
    "The final `SELECT * FROM b` materializes all columns from the filtered CTE `b` into the new table.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 3: Table Creation\n",
    "The `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` statement creates/overwrites the target table with the filtered results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why These Filters?\n",
    "The selected events focus on key user behaviors:\n",
    "- **`App_Launch`**: Tracks app engagement.  \n",
    "- **Loan Calculators**: Identifies users exploring financial products.  \n",
    "- **Device Uninstall/Reinstall**: Signals potential user churn or re-engagement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This filtered dataset is likely used for targeted analysis (e.g., user retention, product interaction).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Output\n",
    "| customer_id | event_name              | event_code        | event_time           | ... |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----|\n",
    "| user123     | App_Launch              | app_open          | 2023-10-05 08:30:00 | ... |  -- Condition A1\n",
    "| user456     | Loans_Car_Calculator    | calculator_used   | 2023-10-05 09:15:00 | ... |  -- Condition A2\n",
    "| user789     | Some_Other_Event        | Device Uninstall  | 2023-10-05 10:00:00 | ... |  -- Condition B\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimization Notes\n",
    "1. **Wildcard Performance**: `LIKE` with leading wildcards (`%`) can be slow on large datasets. Since the pattern `Loans_%_Calculator` has a fixed prefix (`Loans_`), this is optimized for BigQuery’s index usage.  \n",
    "2. **Column Selection**: Only necessary columns are selected in the CTE (no `SELECT *` in the source table).  \n",
    "3. **Table Overwrite**: `CREATE OR REPLACE` ensures idempotency (re-running creates a fresh snapshot).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This setup balances flexibility in event selection with efficient filtering for downstream analytics."
